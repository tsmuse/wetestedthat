## Is your research right for WeTestedThat? 
The goal of WeTestedThat is to create an open and accessible source of foundational research and testing results for HCI. That means your submission must be easily generalizable to at least a category of HCI projects (e.g. e-commerce projects, communications projects, etc) if not all HCI projects.  
## Content guidelines
WeTestedThat is a resource for practitioners. That means our audience is largely those “in the field” working in industry: primarily researchers, designers, developers, and product managers working at a company on in an open source community. While academic research is not barred from submission, it will likely need to be reformatted to suite this non-academic audience. WeTestedThat is not as informal as a blog, but it’s not as formal as an academic journal.  

### Formatting
All research published needs to include the following:
* An executive summary (generally 300-500 words)
* A main research report that is well structured (i.e. has logical sections with headings) 
* Appendixes that contain research artifacts and data sets
### Data sets
### Research artifacts
### Figures and tables
