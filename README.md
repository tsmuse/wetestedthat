# We Tested That
## Opensource user research and testing results.

### What is We Tested That?
We Tested That is an open-source resource for usability, design, and HCI research and testing results. If you're tired of doing the same studies over and over for different companies or if you are just looking for some real data to use in your project, we aim to be your source for the foundations of most modern HCI projects. 

### Why would you do this?
I got tired of replicating research that has probably been done a thousand times, but that isn't pubically available. I also believe that if we can create an open repository of the broadly applicable HCI research that has been conducted to date, we can focus our research efforts on new, exciting, and specific research and testing topics that can move the discipline forward. 

### How do I contribute?
Check out the [issues section](https://github.com/tsmuse/wetestedthat/issues) to see what the current to do list for the project is. This project is concerned with building the content archive of research results to open source, the submission guidelines for adding research to We Tested That, a list of proposed studies we'd like to see added to the archive, and other "policy and content" things. If you're looking for the respository with the website code, that link will be added here when it exists.  

All the files in this part of the project are Markdown files that you can edit directly in github (or you can download the files and push them normally if you'd prefer.) If you'd like to contribute either fork the project and push pull requests or send an email to tony at notjustprettypictures.com to request access. 

I know this isn't as easy to use as a public wiki, but this is the only way to keep things from getting vandalized and still work on this in the open without having to spend hours and hour moderating activity on the project. Github has [great resources](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) to get you up and running with  Git if you don't know how to use it, including an [OS X](https://mac.github.com/) and [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) app. Come play with us!

### Who is doing this?
[Not Just Pretty Pictures](http://www.notjustprettypictures.com) is a product design studio and we use research ALL THE TIME. This is one of the times where I had an idea that was a think I wanted that other people responded to with "YES! I would love to have that!" so we're making it for all the good people of the Internet, to push forward HCI "in the field" and for our own selfish research using reasons, and we hope you'll join us.
